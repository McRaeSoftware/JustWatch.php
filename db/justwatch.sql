What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world\'s oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate\'s long-lost brother...but only if they can learn to work together.

Edit Trivia (Cameo) Nolan North: the voice actor for Nathan Drake in the video games, as a hotel guest lounging in a beach when he is approached by Tom Holland\'s version of the character. When he confronts Holland about his appearance, he replies that he fell out of a car that fell out of a plane. North responds that something similar happened to him once. This a subtle nod to his performance in Uncharted 3: Drake\'s Deception, which the cargo plane sequence in the film is based upon. Goofs The smallest of the carracks that Magellan set out with was called the Victoria, and weighed 85 tons. A Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane is able to lift, at maximum, a load of about 10 tons. A single Skycrane would not even come close to being able to lift an empty carrack, let alone one that was laden with significant amounts of gold.

Freeing her, he gains a close friendship with the bird. However, Cody is soon abducted by the murderous poacher, Percival McLeach, who is after that bird which is of a highly endangered species and therefore an extremely profitable quarry. In a panic, a mouse Cody freed from one of McLeach\'s traps sends a desperate call for help to the Rescue Aid Society in New York City who assigns their top agents, Miss Bianca and Bernard, to the task. With transportation provided by the goofy albatross, Wilbur, the agents arrive in Australia and link up with the RAS\' local field operative, Jake the Kangaroo Rat.
